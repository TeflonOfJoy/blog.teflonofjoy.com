# Hi!
Hello it's my first time journaling so bear with me, I started this journal to get closer to my life goals

## The three questions
- [x] Why do I want to start journaling?
- [x] What do I want to achieve with it?
- [x] Where is it going to help me throughout my journey?

### Why
I want to start journaling to better understand myself and take care of my mental health
### What
I want to be able to look back at this endeavor in a few years and say "Thank god I did it"
### Where
This one is the hardest, to be honest I don't know exactly where it's going to help me and where it's gonna take me.
I just know one thing: I have to keep moving.
