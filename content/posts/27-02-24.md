### Hi... Again
Hey, been a long time since I last wrote here, this project has been slowly falling out of my grasp for a long time.
In the meantime I've been at it, I stopped working, continued my studies and then started working again, but this time on a rather interesting project...

### The project in question
Kafka, ever heard of it? Me neither, it's an event streaming platform always connected always sending data, I've been contacted to finish a project started a while ago.
It consists in using kafka for big storage management, basically the company has many storage houses all over the world that collect new items, every item that finds its way
into the sistem has to pass through kafka and then (the client applett) gets the raw data filters it and sends it to a database where it will be used by a management software.

### See ya
So that's the gist of things, till next time!
